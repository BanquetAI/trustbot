# TrustBot User Assistance Roadmap

**Philosophy**: This is a journey. Trust and integrations require education and guidance. The app must embody this by holding users' hands through the learning process.

---

## Core Principle

TrustBot isn't just software - it's an educational platform for AI governance. Users need to understand:
- What AI agents are and how they work
- Why trust tiers matter
- How to safely grant autonomy
- When to intervene vs. let agents work

---

## Assistance Rails (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Sprint)
- [x] Demo Mode - bypass auth for testing
- [x] Spawn Tutorial - interactive walkthrough
- [x] **AI Agent Glossary** - 40+ terms across 6 categories with search
- [x] **Contextual Tooltips** - hover help on buttons, tiers, statuses, HITL controls
- [ ] "Why?" explanations on trust decisions

### Phase 2: Guided Learning
- [ ] Progressive disclosure - reveal features as user learns
- [ ] Achievement system for learning milestones
- [ ] "First time" prompts for each feature
- [ ] Video walkthroughs (2-3 min each)
- [ ] Interactive scenarios (sandbox mode)

### Phase 3: Deep Understanding
- [ ] Trust decision explainers ("Why was this approved/denied?")
- [ ] Agent behavior analysis ("What is this agent doing and why?")
- [ ] Risk assessment explanations
- [ ] Compliance mapping (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)

### Phase 4: Mastery
- [ ] Custom governance templates
- [ ] Advanced audit queries
- [ ] Multi-org management
- [ ] API documentation with examples
