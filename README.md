# 🏢 TrustBot System

> **Tier 5 Super-Autonomous Agent Orchestration with Holonic Swarm Intelligence**

## Overview

TrustBot is a self-bootstrapping agent hierarchy where **5 Supreme Orchestrators (T5)** create and govern all lower-tier agents. The system features:

- 🧠 **Holonic Architecture** - Agents are autonomous wholes AND parts of larger systems
- 🐝 **Swarm Intelligence** - Emergent collective behavior through stigmergy and consensus
- 📝 **Blackboard System** - Shared knowledge space for collaborative problem-solving
- 📉 **Fading HITL** - Human oversight starts at 100% and decreases as trust builds
- 🏢 **Building UI** - Visual office environment where agents work and collaborate

## The 5 Supreme Orchestrators

| Agent | Role | Icon |
|-------|------|------|
| **T5-Executor** | Supreme Commander - Final authority on all decisions | 🎖️ |
| **T5-Planner** | Strategic Architect - Designs workforce structure | 🧠 |
| **T5-Validator** | Trust Guardian - Ensures trust requirements are met | 🛡️ |
| **T5-Evolver** | Adaptive Intelligence - Continuously improves system | 🧬 |
| **T5-Spawner** | Agent Factory - Creates all lower-tier agents | 🏭 |

## Trust Levels

```
SOVEREIGN (T5) → EXECUTIVE (T4) → TACTICAL (T3) → OPERATIONAL (T2) → WORKER (T1) → PASSIVE (T0)
```

## HITL Governance

The human is the **Governing Agent** of this virtual company. Agents operate autonomously but:
- Submit daily reports for review
- Run future plans through morning check-ins
- Seek approval for strategic decisions
- Maintain full transparency via Listeners
